# Progress Pride Flag

Originally created by designer Daniel Quasar, the Progress Pride Flag includes elements from the Philadelphia pride flag and trans pride flags, to the to bring a focus on inclusion and progress within the LGBTQIA+ community.

Replaces the Russian Flag where it's present in San Andreas. 

It can be used as a basis for replacing other flags by renaming the file name of the appropriate flag in GTA 5.
